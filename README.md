A small fork that adds a few useful features to Stats that I needed:

- Show a manual refresh button on every module
- Refresh automatically after closing/restarting any app
- Add hold alt + click on x to force close an app in the ram and cpu modules
- Add hold cmd + click on an app icon to restart it in the ram and cpu modules
- Allow combining processes in the CPU module

Use the "all-features" branch to check this work out. Ask any good AI agent to prepare the certificate and build it for you.

 My PRs were closed instantly on original repo without any explanation, even though the code was reviewed and followed best practices.
