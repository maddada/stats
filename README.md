A small fork that adds a few useful features to Stats that I needed:

- Show a manual refresh button on every module
- Refresh automatically after closing/restarting any app
- Add right click menu to all processes in Ram/CPU modules (Restart, Quit, Force Quit)
- Allow showing all your processes in the ram/cpu modules (there's a 15 process limit in the original)

Use the "all-features" branch to check this work out. Ask any good AI agent to prepare the certificate and build it for you.

My PRs were closed on the original repo without any explanation, even though the code was reviewed and followed best practices.
Will try to keep this synced with the main repo every few weeks.
